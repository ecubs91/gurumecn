  Maria Review: "Maria was not a tutor - she was a teacher who helped me to take a step further as a student and as a person. Through our sessions, I did not only develop a broader understanding of the subject (Law) but also became more reflective of the significance of the subject and the kind of person I wish to be by studying the subject. This, without any doubt, strengthened my university application in the most significant way and I can not be more thankful that I met her."
  Maria Student: Kim, Law offer from Oxford University
  Harry Review: "Harry is a very dedicated tutor. He tried to give me as much time as possible in order to prepare, even when he was abroad! His enthusiasm for the subject rubbed off on me and the questions he provided were well suited to my personal statement as well the specific college I applied to. His wide range of contacts really helped because he has a large bank of questions at hand. Whenever I was on the wrong track, he would guide to the correct answer without telling me the final answer and he always had a follow up question for me."
  Harry Student: Jei, Biochemistry offer from Oxford University
  Edmond Review: "Edmond gave me a good understanding of how to prepare for the interview. Mock interviews along with his tips and advise made me more confident of presenting myself on the actual day. If not for meeting Edmond through GuruMe, I would have not known how to go about my preparation."
  Edmond Student: Lee, Economics offer from Cambridge University
  Tom Review: "The practice questions given by Tom were top notch. I felt like it gave me a lot more confidence walking into the interview. Some of the questions were so similar to the actual questions that were asked so much so that I think Tom has been a major contributor to my success in getting an offer."
  Tom Student: Yu, Chemistry offer from Oxford University
  Holly Review: "She was absolutely amazing! The tutoring was focused on preparing for university entry. She was so patient and encouraging and was always willing to help me whenever I needed her help. She was incredibly knowledgeable, kind, helpful and sincere. I was offered a place and I honestly could not have done it without Holly."
  Holly Student: Anonymous, Geography offer from Oxford University
  Rohan Review: "The tuition was conducted in an extremely professional way, with a lot of specific feedback and a thorough analysis of the key points An ideal tutor for an interview!"
  Rohan Review 2: "The content of Rohan's mock interview was very useful while I was conducting my actual interview. The tips and general advice he gave me was accurate, and gave me a better idea of what to expect going into the interviews than any other source I had looked at online."
  Rohan Student: Lukasz, E&M offer from Oxford University
  Luke Review: "The mock interview for PPE offered by Luke was a great help for me - with Oxford-style questions chosen based on past questions and the newest trends in the curriculum, I have come to realise my own strengths and weaknesses, and his suggested readings (especially the part on logic and democracies) are particularly useful. I am much better equipped for the interview now - thank you Luke!"

  Nat Review: "Nathaniel guided me to really think about my works, suggested different approaches and gave me many specific advices. He really knows what the Oxford's tutors are looking for, without his tutions, I wouldn't feel so confident and comfortable in the interviews and practicle test, Thanks so much Nat!"
  
  Louis Review: "Louis had been very helpful to me when i was struggling to find a correct route to go about doing medicine for a degree. He had given me a lot of sources and reading materials which would increase my chances of getting a placement for the universities... "
  Sharon Review: "Sharon is really helpful! She is always there to answer all my questions during my application. The mock interview section is particularly useful. I really enjoy the experience. Many thanks to her!"
  Kalila Review: "This tutor was very helpful, and catapulted me into a position, in which, I felt confident and prepared for my admissions test. Additionally, the tutor, was very down-to-earth and could easily be reached on skype, despite my geographical location. 5/5 - Thanks!"
  Lily Review: "Lily helped me with university interview practice. I only had one session, but she proved to be extremely helpful. She structured my interview in the same format as the real thing, asked good questions and gave me lots of useful feedback. She is very prompt to respond if you have any questions... "

  #written content      
  Written Content: Written Content      
  Written Content p: Arts subjects at Oxbridge sometimes require submission of a piece of written work. For these pieces of work, tutors are looking for four specific attributes
  Written Contet p2: The coursework submitted must thus be taken as a chance to show that you have these skills and attributes. It is not expected that your work is perfect, but these attributes have to be present. These four attributes will be broken down below.
  Passion: Passion
  Passion p: Tutors want to see applicants who show genuine interest in the subject. The easiest way to convey this is to demonstrate an interest in your subject that goes beyond your schoolwork. You should demonstrate through your coursework that you have read widely on the topic and gone beyond the syllabus.
  Knowledge: Knowledge
  Knowledge p: This is closely linked to passion. Demonstrate that you have read widely on the subject and command a firm grasp of the important issues contained therein. 
  Analytical ability: Analytical ability
  Analytical ability p: Analytical skill is the ability to deconstruct, make sense of and utilise given information effectively to quickly identify the issues at stake and the possible resolutions. A common mistake to be avoided is slipping into narrative, where a story rather than an argument is presented. The ability to convey the salient points of an argument in a clear and concise manner is the mark of a good writer.
  Sophisticated arguments: Sophisticated arguments
  Sophisticated arguments p: Constructing a sophisticated argument involves being able to consider an issue from multiple angles. There might not be a  ‘right’ answer at all, but it is still important to find a position which you incline towards and can defend in a persuasive manner.
  Last Notes: Last Notes
  Last Notes p: The role of the submitted coursework in Oxbridge admissions varies. Some colleges use it to consider whom to invite for interview. Others use it to form the basis of the interview. Because of this, your written coursework should be on a topic that you are ready to discuss with an expert. This means having read widely enough and thought deeply enough on the issues involved so that you can hold your own in an intellectual conversation. Colleges have no real preference between writing a piece of coursework from scratch or using one from existing schoolwork. So long as your work demonstrates your analytical skills and writing ability and covers a topic you are passionate and knowledgeable about, you will do well.
  
  #Oxbridge interviews
  What are interviewers looking for?: What are interviewers looking for?
  Ability to think: Ability to think
  interviews quote1: “Interviewers are not necessarily looking for the right answer but one that shows innovative thinking”
  Admissions Tutor: Admissions Tutor
  Head of Undergraduate Admissions: Head of Undergraduate Admissions
  interviews quote2: “We're looking for students who are intelligent - very interested in their subject and who can demonstrate their interest”
  interviews p1: Interviews are used to assess applicants’ academic excellence and potential but, in addition, they provide a way for universities to assess applicants’ passion for subjects they wish to study. Oxford and Cambridge are famous for how important interviews are in their admissions process.
  interviews p2: Subjects that do not require admissions test invite most of their applicants to the interview while subjects that do invite approximately -50% of applicants. Cambridge invites most of applicants for interviews (many of those invited to interviews will sit admissions test during the interview period). 
  Interview Format: Interview Format
  interviews p3: Oxbridge applicants are usually interviewed by 2 or 3 tutors (who will likely be your subject tutors and teach you if you get in), and may have up to two interviews with each interview being 20-30 minutes long. In Oxford, 1 interview will be at your chosen college while the other one will be a randomly allocated college. This is different to Cambridge where all your interviews are held at your chosen college. Students will often be asked to talk about what interests them about the subject they are applying to study, based on their personal statement, or books or articles they have read recently.
  interviews p4: Interviewees may be given some texts to read and prepare before the interviews*
  interviews p5: Interviews will usually  consist of 3-5 sets of questions, starting with A-Level standard question and gradually moving up to University first year level questions. Applicants are not expected to be able to answer university level questions so interviewers will give hints, and the emphasis is on how quickly students can absorb new concepts and solve unseen problems, and how much passion and interest they have for the new concepts they are exposed to.
